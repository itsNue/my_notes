- way of showing how I design a certain thing to others, in here it's to recruiters
- tell a story
```" The story behind is what makes the design valuable, everyone can draw the Apple Logo but only the mastermind,Â [**Rob Janoff**](https://www.logodesignlove.com/rob-janoff-apple-logo-designer), knows the story behind it "```

##### This is the way

1. Hero Image
	- cover image, so the product stands out
2. Info
	- Timeline , Team members, Role, Platform, Tools
3. Intro
	- What's the project about
	- Cut straight to the point

5. Goals
	- What am I trying to achieve
6. Design
	- Proposed solution through wireframes, sketches, prototype
